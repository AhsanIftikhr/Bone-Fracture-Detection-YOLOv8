# 🦴 Bone Fracture Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains the implementation of a bone fracture detection deep learning model using YOLOv8. The model is trained on X-ray images to automatically detect and localize bone fractures with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Bone fractures are common injuries, and their identification through X-ray imaging can be time–consuming and prone to human error. This project uses **YOLOv8**, a modern real-time object detection model, to automate fracture detection from medical images.
